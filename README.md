# Assemblee Data Interfaces

This repo provides with schemas and typescript interfaces based on french parlament data. 

It brings two sets of files : 

- schemas extracted from the dumps provided by french parlament
- Typescript interfaces generated from schemas

The interfaces are intended to provide guidelines on the data structures provided more. If you intend to implement those you might want to pick and modify provided types instead of using those a raws.
